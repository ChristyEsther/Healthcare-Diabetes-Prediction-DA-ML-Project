# Healthcare-Diabetes-Prediction-DA-ML-Project
Machine learning model to predict diabetes using age, heart rate, and other relevant variables, leveraging comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, ML and Data visualization
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately determining whether a patient has diabetes or not. 
Diabetes is a chronic and costly disease with significant consequences for individuals' health, quality of life, and healthcare systems. 
Timely and accurate identification of diabetes can lead to better management and improved patient outcomes. 
To achieve this, we will employ machine learning techniques to analyze the provided dataset and create a model that can make reliable predictions.
